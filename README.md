# QR Code Scanner from PDF (Python)

This Python script scans and decodes QR codes embedded in a PDF file. If a QR code contains a URL, it will automatically open it in your default web browser.

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- [Poppler](http://blog.alivate.com.au/poppler-windows/) (required for `pdf2image` to work)
- Python packages:
  - opencv-python
  - pyzbar
  - pdf2image
  - numpy

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository or download the files.**

2. **Install the required Python packages**  
   Run this command in your terminal or command prompt to install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Poppler**
   - **Windows**:  
     Download from [this link](http://blog.alivate.com.au/poppler-windows/), extract it, and add the `bin` folder to your system‚Äôs PATH.
   - **macOS**:  
     Use Homebrew:
     ```
     brew install poppler
     ```

## üöÄ Usage

1. Open the script and update the PDF path:
   ```python
   pdf_path = "C:\Users\YourName\Path\To\yourfile.pdf"
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

3. The script will:
   - Convert each page of the PDF into an image
   - Detect QR codes on each page
   - Print the decoded data to the terminal
   - Automatically open any URLs found in your browser

## ‚úÖ Example Output

```
QR Code Data (Page 1): https://example.com
QR Code Data (Page 2): Hello World
Scanned QR code on Page 2 is not a URL.
No QR code found on Page 3.
```

## üìå Notes

- Best results are achieved with clear and high-resolution PDFs (300 DPI recommended).
- If QR codes are too small or blurry, they may not be detected.
